## About
The **Shell, basics** projects improved my understanding of navigating a system and manipulating files through a command line interface. I learned quintessential **Bash** and **Linux commands** such as `cd`, `ls`, `pwd` and many more. I also learned about system directories such as `/bin`, `/dev`, and the difference between a hard link and a symbolic link.
